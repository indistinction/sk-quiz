# QUIZ CHECK
This code has been ported over from a private repo as an example of my work - RD

## Description
A simple timed quiz to allow student teachers to demonstrate their subject knowledge during recruitment interviews.

## Tech Stack
* **Backend**: Flask + vanilla MySQL (via Pooled DB to allow better management of connection pools - see ./backend)
* **Frontend**: Vue.js + Vuex + Bootstrap (see ./src - this could easily have been written entirely in Flask, but the additional functionality of Vue allowed for better UX overall)

## Status

Currently in use by the client.
